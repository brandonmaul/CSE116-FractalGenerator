The number of Pixels the fractal generates is based on single number in the model.Model class called _gridSize. This integer is specified when the Model class is constructed.

This number creates a 1:1 grid of the pixels, with each row and column being the size of _gridSize.

To check this at any point in time while the program is running, click on the "Size" menu in the menu bar. 
(The "set fractal size" was an extra feature we were working on that would allow resizing while running, but we never got to finish...)

Feel free to change the _gridSize value at line 35 in model.Model to see how it affects the rest of the program. 

However please note that window size is always 1/2 the size of the fractal, to save up some space on the really large fractals and maintain a constant ratio for the zoom box,
so changing _gridSize will change the size of the window.
