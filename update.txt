Each team include a file named update.txt which tells the TAs how to update the escape time and verify invalid times are rejected/impossible. 

Update the escape distance : 
While the program is running 
There is a tab called escape distance. Click it. 
Then press Set Escape Distance 
Enter a positive integer and then press ok. 


Verify invalid distances are rejected/impossible:

If a user enters a String an error message saying
 "That is not a valid input will appear."
 
 If a user enters a negative number: 
 The program will say "Enter a POSITIVE integer."
 
 If a user enters a decimal an error message saying:
 "That is not a valid input" will appear
 
 
 PHASE 3 UPDATE:
 
 For Phase 3 we added the ability to enter the max Escape Time in as well.
 
 The menu bar contains a Max Escape Time submenu. Click on that to view the current Max Escape Time, or change it.
 You may only enter values in from 1 - 255. Other entries will result in nothing happening and an error message.
