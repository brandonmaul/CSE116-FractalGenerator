Each team include a file named update.txt which tells the TAs how to update the escape time and verify invalid times are rejected/impossible. 

Update the escape time : 
While the program is running 
There is a tab called escape distance. Click it. 
Then press Set Escape Distance 
Enter a positive integer and then press ok. 


Verify invalid times are rejected/impossible:

If a user enters a String an error message saying
 "That is not a valid input will appear."
 
 If a user enters a negative number: 
 The program will say "Enter a POSITIVE integer."
 
 If a user enters a decimal an error message saying:
 "That is not a valid input" will appear
