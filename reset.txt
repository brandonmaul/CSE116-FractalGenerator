How to Zoom and Reset Zoom:

The Zoom method can be used by just clicking (with either left or right mouse button) and dragging anywhere on the fractal. 
Note that the zoom can only be used if dragged TOP LEFT TO BOTTOM RIGHT. 
Trying to zoom in other direction will cancel the zoom operation!
Also, you can single click with the opposite mouse button to cancel the zoom as well.

To reset the zoom to view 100% of the fractal --
	In the menu bar there is a "Zoom" menu with one button within it. This button is called "Reset Zoom"...
	This will set the zoomed region back to the maximum size for the fractal.
